       Making informed food choices is a vital component of a healthy lifestyle, especially in an age where fast food and unhealthy snacks are widely consumed. As digital solutions continue to evolve, a smart approach to suggesting healthier food alternatives has become highly beneficial. 

This project presents a mobile-based application titled SnackSmart, developed using Kotlin in
Android Studio. The application is designed to help users discover nutritious substitutes for junk
food by analyzing dietary preferences and common eating habits. It allows users to register, input
relevant personal information such as age, weight, health conditions, and exercise levels, and
receive personalized snack suggestions accordingly.

The app integrates Firebase Firestore for real-time data storage, enabling users to save their
favorite healthy snacks and access them later under a dedicated section. Additionally, motivational
health tips are displayed dynamically after login, promoting better lifestyle choices. The intuitive
user interface, crafted using XML and Kotlin, ensures a smooth experience from registration to snack
recommendation.

SnackSmart serves as a practical example of how mobile development and cloud technology can be
combined to create meaningful wellness solutions. It emphasizes the value of user-centric design,
data handling, and logic-based customization to address real-world problems effectively.
The core objective is to provide a convenient and educational tool that not only supports healthy
habits but also deepens the understanding of mobile app development with real-world impact.
